Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Questions
General Understanding of the Data
    1. Data Overview: What is the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns)?
    2. Missing Values: Are there any missing values in the dataset? If yes, how significant are they?
    3. Data Types: What are the data types of each column (numerical, categorical)?
    4. Summary Statistics: Calculate basic statistical measures for numerical columns (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max).
    5. Unique Values: Explore unique values for categorical columns.
Understanding Customer Behavior
    6. Customer Demographics:
        ◦ What is the gender distribution of customers?
        ◦ What is the age distribution of customers?
        ◦ Is there a relationship between gender and age?
    7. Customer Location:
        ◦ How many customers live or work near the gym?
        ◦ Does living or working near the gym affect churn?
    8. Customer Engagement:
        ◦ How many customers are partners, used promo codes, or provided phone numbers?
        ◦ Is there a relationship between these factors and churn?
    9. Customer Tenure:
        ◦ What is the average customer lifetime?
        ◦ How does customer lifetime relate to churn?
    10. Churn Rate:
    • What is the overall churn rate?
    • Is there a difference in churn rate between different customer segments (e.g., gender, age, location)?

Visualizations
    • Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots) to explore the data and identify patterns.
    • Analyze the distribution of numerical variables.
    • Explore relationships between variables (e.g., churn vs. age, churn vs. lifetime).
